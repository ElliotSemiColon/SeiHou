Issues to do with scaling: 

	- boss' bullets move too fast at small resolutions

		let bullets do the modifying of perameters, not the emitter
		the issue before was the emitter and the bullet were both modifying the speed of the bullets, this was fixed by setting up a scaling value in bullet 
		getting rid of the scaler in the emitter class was also important 

	- plus objects are far too large when giving graze and converting bullets to points

		
		
	- boss' hitbox doesn't scale yet 
	- bullets are visible when the height is greater than the width*4/3 below the play aera 

		fixed by rendering a big square below the play area when width is below a certain ratio with the height ->> ctx.fillRect(0,c.height,c.width,-footer); //ln 160 game.js

	- performance problems to do with large number of bullet objects doing maths
